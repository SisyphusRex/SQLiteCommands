View
  A virtual table defined by a query
  Why?
    Simplify (remove unnecessary columns)
    Aggregate (perform function on set of values, or group into set)
    Partition (divide data into logical pieces)
    Secure (hide columns, keep data from being modified)

CREATE VIEW "<view_name>" AS
SELECT ...;
  - this saves the view and is part of the schema

DROP VIEW "<name>";
  - deletes the view

CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW "<view_name>" AS
SELECT ...;
  - view disappears after db connection ended

CTE Common Table Expression
  View that exists for a single query
    WITH "<name>" AS (
      SELECT ...
    ),
    SELECT ... FROM "<name>";

Mask Column Data:
  Either omit the column from SELECT ...
  or 
  SELECT 'Anonymous' AS "rider" FROM "rides";

Trigger for View
  CREATE TRIGGER "delete"
  INSTEAD OF DELETE ON "<view>"
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
    UPDATE "<table>" SET "deleted" = 1
    WHERE "id" = OLD."id";
  END;
