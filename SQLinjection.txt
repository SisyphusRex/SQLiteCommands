Hacker can abuse application input that makes SQL query:

For example, Login with username and password inputs
SQL query to find user is:
SELECT * FROM "users"
WHERE "username" = '<input_string>' AND "password" = '<input_string>';

If hacker inputs hacker'-- as password, then query is
SELECT * from "users"
WHERE "username" = 'hacker'--' AND "password" = '<whatever>';

You can see that the query string is truncated and -- means ignore any statements after this.
This bypasses the password check.
